### FollowerService
Implemented the followerModel.py, which creates the follower-followee relationship to be inserted into the Followers table within the database.
Implemented the followlogic.py which handles the inputs from the Frontend, and processes it by checking if the username exists and if the relationship is allowed. Then the follow relationship is created.
Implemented the queryFunctions.py which will be used to handle querying information from the database (followlogic.py also does querying within it for now but later on, I will move it into the queryFunctions.py file).
