I maintained and enhanced the frontend theme of the system by updating button styles and color schemes, resulting in a smoother and more cohesive user interface. I also improved the account login system to make it dynamic, ensuring user credentials are properly posted and handled upon login. Additionally, I made changes to the meal form, enabling it to correctly add meals to our database and allowing users to retrieve and input information seamlessly. I'm currently working on the backend to ensure this data is stored correctly in the database. Finally, I am working on implementing the Pie chart system as well to graphically show nutrients entered as well.

## Adrien Hopkins

I have done the following:

- Completed the units system (add mass & energy units, and custom code for feet and inches)
- Added privacy setting to profiles
- Added API for setting health data & calculating BMR
- Added links to the buttons on the homepage
