I have done the setups for Django and Vue.js and also installed some libaries (following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg5zkd9nm6w). 
In case you need to redo the setups follow the first two topics of the video or follow this tutorial (for only Django): https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/.

Will implement more details and functions to the pages soon.
# Note: 
Maintain the folders' organization when you are downloading. Some files already require specific address paths to get the necessary packages.
